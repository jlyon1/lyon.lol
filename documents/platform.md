## Communication

I wish to increase openness and communication with my constituents. There was a large push to increase student government involvement this year and I hope to continue this movement with my fellow senators.

I personally intend to open a line of communication between myself and the people I would represent. This would occur either through a communication line on [lyon.lol](https://lyon.lol) or via email and other forms of communication.

## Student Government Web Infrastructure

 I hope to continue to work on student government provided web services through the Web Technologies Group, and ensure these products fit the needs of the student body as both open source teaching tools, as well as utilities for frequent use.
