## Communication

I wish to increase openness and communication with my constituents. There was a large push to increase student government involvement this year and I hope to continue this movement with my fellow senators.

I personally intend to open a line of communication between myself and the people I would represent. This would occur either through a communication line on [lyon.lol](https://lyon.lol) or via email and other forms of communication.

I enjoy communicating with other members of student government and have relationships with both members of senate and Eboard, I intend to leverage these relationships as well as form new relationships to improve communication between the branches of student government.

## Student Government Web Infrastructure

I hope to continue to work on student government provided web services through the Web Technologies Group, and ensure these products fit the needs of the student body as both open source teaching tools, as well as utilities for frequent use. I intend to continue to flesh out the current Web Tech projects as well as develop new endeavors for Web Tech to pursue.

## Outside Impact

As a member of the representative body of the student union, I will do my best to ensure my actions are measured against the needs of the student body in terms of public representation. I will operate with the knowledge that I am representing the student body in everything I do as a member of the senate.
