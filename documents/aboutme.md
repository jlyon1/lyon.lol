# About Me

## Student Government
My name is Joseph Lyon, I am a Computer Systems Engineering and Computer Science student in the class of 2020. I spent the beginning year of my college career getting involved with the Poly, from which I gained a deeper understanding of issues that student government deals with. Looking for ways to get involved, I joined the Web Technologies Group, where I was able to simultaneously able to do things I loved, and benefit the student body.

I quickly became enamored with the idea that what I was doing had an impact on the student body and student government as a whole. I made it my personal mission to ensure my Web Tech projects benefited the student government to their fullest possible extent.

With my college experience having been shaped by my involvement with and around student government, mostly looking in from the outside, I am running for senator in order to have greater impact. I did not run for reelection for my role as Contributing Editor for the poly in order to focus on my other endeavors, mainly student government and Web Techn. I want to get more people involved in student government, and ensure people feel their voices are heard. Regardless of if I am elected, I intend to continue my work with Web Tech and continue to ensure the needs of my class are represented.
